      <h2>My Day — <i>Haribodhini Ekadashi</i></h2>

      <p>Today was <b>Haribodhini Ekadashi</b>, so I had to go to <b>Kali Gandaki</b> to take a holy bath. I woke up at <b>4:30 AM</b>, and today I <b>completed</b> writing my book <i>Haribodhini Ekadashi</i>. After writing it, I uploaded it on the internet and made it available for everyone for free. Then I waited for my village <b>dai</b> — not my own brother but from the village.</p>

      <p>We didn’t have our personal bike, so we had to go by walk. We started at <b>5:45 AM</b> and reached <b>Kali Gandaki</b> exactly at <b>9:00 AM</b>, so it took us <b>3 hours 15 minutes (195 minutes)</b>. We didn’t even feel like we walked that far because we were talking.</p>

      <p>When we reached there, we saw the river was dirty because of the rainy day, so he wasn’t satisfied seeing that. He had dreamed of taking a holy bath in clean water, but after seeing that, he didn’t feel active. Later, some grandparents came and said, “Let’s go together to a place where two rivers meet.” So we followed them. We first dipped our body in <b>Kali Gandaki</b> and later washed with another clear river water. There were also two big sisters — they were so kind.</p>

      <p>They also put <b>tika</b> on my forehead; I felt so touched. I did <i>namaste</i> and when we left, we said bye to them. My dad told me to bring <b>pala</b>, so we found it in the bazar. On the way, my village big brother said, “Let’s go to that hill.” It was so far, and I didn’t take it seriously, so just as a joke, I said, “Let’s go.” Then we actually went. The way was so hard, and I was on <i>barta</i> (fast). I had only eaten two small bananas and two apples, so I didn’t have much energy.</p>

      <p>When we walked up that hill, I was so exhausted, I could barely walk. There wasn’t any road, and no vehicle came to my hometown, so I had only one option — to walk. But I was so energy-less I could barely move, almost fainted, but luckily it didn’t happen. I’m very thankful to <b>Lord Shiva</b> — if not for God’s blessing, I would have been in a very bad position, probably might have died. I was so hungry, and the eating place was far away, and no one could help me.</p>

      <p>While walking, I was chanting <b>“Shambh Sadha Shiv”</b>, which I learned from <b>Shree Premanand Ji Maharaj</b>. Luckily, I reached the top, then went and ate a full plate of <i>chowmein</i>. We took pictures at that place — it’s also considered a famous and holy place. Then we came back.</p>

      <p>While coming home, suddenly my leg started hurting so much, it felt like it was detached from my body, and I couldn’t move. So I sat there and asked for a stick from an old grandmother, then started walking again. But the road was downhill, so I couldn’t walk properly because my leg hurt only on the downhill path, not on the straight. So I walked backward — it didn’t hurt then. I also found another stick, and finally, we came home. We reached home at <b>7 PM</b>.</p>

      <p><b>Today I walked 8 hours 50 minutes, 32 km, burned 2149 kcal, and took 53,563 steps.</b></p>

      <h3>🌿 What I Learned Today</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Faith gives strength</b> when the body feels weak — chanting <i>Shambh Sadha Shiv</i> helped me keep going.</li>
        <li><b>Good people lighten the journey</b> — talking and walking with my dai made the path feel shorter.</li>
        <li><b>Real blessings come after struggle</b> — the holy bath, tika, and kind strangers felt like rewards.</li>
        <li><b>Don’t underestimate your limits</b> — I proved I’m stronger than I think.</li>
        <li><b>Gratitude matters</b> — I’m thankful to Lord Shiva, kind strangers, and the lessons from pain.</li>
      </ul>
